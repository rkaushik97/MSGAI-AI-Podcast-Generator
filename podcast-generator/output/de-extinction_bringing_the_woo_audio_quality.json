Welcome to the Adaptive AI podcast, where we explore the intersection of technology, science, and humanity. I'm your host, Ethan Thompson. Today, we have Dr. Caspian Orion, a renowned geneticist and expert in de-extinction, joining us to discuss the possibility of reviving the woolly mammoth. Dr. Orion, how close are we to actually bringing back the woolly mammoth? We're making significant progress. By sequencing the woolly mammoth genome, we can identify the genetic differences between it and the Asian elephant, its closest living relative. We can then use gene editing techniques to introduce those traits into the elephant genome, effectively creating a hybrid that shares many characteristics with the woolly mammoth. there are still many technical, ethical, and logistical challenges to overcome before we can successfully de-extinct, though.",
