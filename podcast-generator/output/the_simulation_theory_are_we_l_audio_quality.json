Sounds like science fiction, but what if this was reality? Welcome to the Adaptive AI podcast, where we explore the intersection of technology and human experience. I'm your host, Ryan Thompson. Today, we have Dr. Elijah Everett, a philosopher specializing in the nature of reality, joining us to discuss the simulation theory. Thanks for having me, Ryan. It's a pleasure to explore this mind-bending idea with you. Elijah, what is the simulation theory? And why do some people believe it's true? The theory proposes that our reality is a simulation created by a more advanced civilization. Some argue that the sheer complexity and precision of our world suggests it's too perfect to be real. Additionally, the rapid progress in computer technology and AI raises the possibility that a civilization could create such a simulation. It's a thought-provoking idea that challenges our",
