These observatories were not just scientific tools\u2014they were deeply intertwined with religion and agriculture.

These microbes communicate with the brain through the vagus nerve and the immune system. Research suggests that imbalances in the gut microbiome can affect anxiety, stress responses, and even social behaviors. Diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can shift this delicate ecosystem, potentially altering behavior over time.\nHOST: That\u2019s fascinating! Can adjusting our diet really change how we feel day-to-day?\nGUEST: Absolutely.

It\u2019s great to be here and explore these fascinating layers of our past.\nHOST: Dr. Voss, to start, why have secret societies had such a persistent influence throughout history?\nGUEST: Secret societies often thrive because they operate in shadows, influencing politics, economics, and culture without public scrutiny. They provide members with exclusive knowledge and networks, creating loyalty and power structures that extend far beyond their visible footprint. Many of them also blend symbolism, ritual, and secrecy to reinforce their cohesion and mystique. Their influence is subtle but can pivot major historical events.\nHOST: Can you give an example of one such society still impacting modern institutions?\nGUEST: Certainly.
