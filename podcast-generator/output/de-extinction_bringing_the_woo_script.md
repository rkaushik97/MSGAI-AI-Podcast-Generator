            HOST: Welcome to the Adaptive AI Podcast, I'm your host, Ryan Thompson, and today we're diving into the fascinating topic of de-extinction, specifically bringing back the Woolly Mammoth. Our guest expert is Dr. Helena Anders, a renowned geneticist with a focus on ancient DNA.
            HOST: Dr. Anders, welcome to the show, and thanks for joining us today.
            GUEST: Thanks for having me, Ryan.
            HOST: For those who might not be familiar, can you give us a brief overview of the de-extinction process and why the Woolly Mammoth is a prime candidate for revival?
            GUEST: De-extinction involves using advanced genetic engineering techniques to resurrect extinct species from preserved DNA samples. The Woolly Mammoth is an attractive target due to the availability of well-preserved remains, particularly in Siberian permafrost. We're talking about a species that roamed the Earth during the last ice age, with a unique genetic makeup that could hold secrets to understanding adaptation and evolution.
            HOST: That's fascinating. What are the biggest technical hurdles you're facing in this project
